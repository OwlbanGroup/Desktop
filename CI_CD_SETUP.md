# Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline Setup

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the OWLban Full Application project, including Python backend, Node.js services, and NVIDIA integration.

## Overview

The enhanced CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Comprehensive testing for both Python and Node.js components
2. **CD Workflow** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`): Multi-stage deployment with staging and production environments
3. **Security Scan Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`): Automated security vulnerability scanning

## CI Workflow Features

### Python Testing
- **Multi-version Matrix**: Tests across Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Runs pytest with coverage reporting
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, Flake8 linting, MyPy type checking
- **Security Scanning**: Safety vulnerability checks for Python dependencies
- **Dependency Caching**: Optimized pip cache for faster builds

### Node.js Testing
- **Jest Test Suite**: Automated unit and integration tests
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style enforcement
- **Security Audit**: NPM vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Caching**: Optimized npm cache

## CD Workflow Features

### Multi-Stage Deployment
- **Staging Environment**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production Environment**: Live application deployment
- **Health Checks**: Automated service health verification
- **Rollback Support**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures

### Docker Integration
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimized Docker images for Python and Node.js
- **Container Registry**: Automated push to Docker Hub
- **Build Caching**: GitHub Actions build cache for faster deployments

## Security Scan Workflow Features

- **Bandit**: Python security vulnerability scanner
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability checker
- **npm audit**: Node.js package security audit
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive container and filesystem vulnerability scanner
- **Scheduled Runs**: Weekly automated security scans
- **SARIF Reports**: Integration with GitHub Security tab

## Required Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

### Docker Hub Credentials
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or access token

### Production Deployment
- `DEPLOY_USER`: SSH username for production server
- `DEPLOY_HOST`: IP address or hostname of production server

### Staging Deployment
- `STAGING_DEPLOY_USER`: SSH username for staging server
- `STAGING_DEPLOY_HOST`: IP address or hostname of staging server

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
   - Add the required secrets listed above

2. **Set Up Environments**:
   - Create `staging` and `production` environments in repository settings
   - Configure environment-specific secrets and protection rules

3. **Server Setup**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed on deployment servers
   - Set up SSH key authentication for GitHub Actions
   - Configure firewall rules for application ports (80, 5000, 4000)

## Workflow Triggers

### CI Workflow
- Triggers on pushes to `main` or `master` branches
- Triggers on pull requests to `main` or `master` branches
- Matrix builds for multiple Python versions

### CD Workflow
- Triggers on successful CI completion
- Triggers only on pushes to `main` or `master` branches
- Separate staging and production deployments

### Security Scan Workflow
- Weekly scheduled runs (Mondays 9 AM UTC)
- Triggers on pushes and pull requests to main branches

## Local Development

### Using Docker Compose
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Start individual services
docker-compose up flask-backend
docker-compose up node-backend

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Local Testing
```bash
# Python testing
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest --cov=.

# Node.js testing
cd OSCAR-BROOME-REVENUE
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions
- Check Actions tab for workflow runs and detailed logs
- Review matrix build results for different Python versions
- Monitor security scan reports in Security tab

### Health Checks
- Application health endpoint: `GET /health`
- Staging health check: `curl http://staging.yourdomain.com/health`
- Production health check: `curl http://yourdomain.com/health`

### Common Issues
- **Build Failures**: Check dependency versions and cache issues
- **Test Failures**: Review test logs and environment setup
- **Deployment Issues**: Verify SSH keys and server configurations
- **Security Alerts**: Review vulnerability reports and update dependencies

## Security Considerations

- **Secret Management**: All credentials encrypted in GitHub Secrets
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scans for all dependencies
- **Container Security**: Trivy scans for container vulnerabilities
- **Access Control**: Environment protection rules for production deployments
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all CI/CD activities

## Architecture
